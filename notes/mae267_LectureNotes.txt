Max fortran line length is 72, need to continue with &
    Max with continues is 132

doxygen --> see fortran code as a flow chart

make sure all floats have decimal points
    will lose points
integer powers are evaluated much faster than real powers
5x --> five spaces
I5 -->  integer right justified within five spaces
'implicit none' means you cant declare variables implicityly
    avoids implicit variable confusion
    have to declare all variables explicitly

counting loops
    DO icounter =  istart, iend, increment

restart a do loop from current line --> 'cycle'

logic tests are computationally expensive --> keep them out of loops
