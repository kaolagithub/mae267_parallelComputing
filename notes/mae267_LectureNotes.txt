hpc1 computing cluster
    8 nodes 16 cores for mae 267
        can use more nodes if not currently in use

on hpc1 file system
    /home/lhalstro/
    to secure your files (user read/write/execute, nothing for anyone else):
        cd /home
        chmod 700 lhalstro

SLURM is the queue system
Jacob has TechPLOT, FIELDVIEW

Homeworks:
    Print out source code
    Give answers to questions

Max fortran line length is 72, need to continue with &
    Max with continues is 132

doxygen --> see fortran code as a flow chart

make sure all floats have decimal points
    will lose points
integer powers are evaluated much faster than real powers
5x --> five spaces
I5 -->  integer right justified within five spaces
'implicit none' means you cant declare variables implicityly
    avoids implicit variable confusion
    have to declare all variables explicitly

counting loops
    DO icounter =  istart, iend, increment

restart a do loop from current line --> 'cycle'

logic tests are computationally expensive --> keep them out of loops

10/1
write 'unformatted' type files to reduce file size (compared to 'formatted')

faster to define array before compile so it doesnt have to do it during execution

fortran is column major order array(column,row)
    different than c++, etc

nice diagram of indexing through arrays vs. through grid, slide 23
