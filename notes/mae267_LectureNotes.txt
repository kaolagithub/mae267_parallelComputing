hpc1 computing cluster
    8 nodes 16 cores for mae 267
        can use more nodes if not currently in use

on hpc1 file system
    /home/lhalstro/
    to secure your files (user read/write/execute, nothing for anyone else):
        cd /home
        chmod 700 lhalstro

SLURM is the queue system
Jacob has TechPLOT, FIELDVIEW

Homeworks:
    Print out source code
    Give answers to questions

Max fortran line length is 72, need to continue with &
    Max with continues is 132

doxygen --> see fortran code as a flow chart

make sure all floats have decimal points
    will lose points
integer powers are evaluated much faster than real powers
5x --> five spaces
I5 -->  integer right justified within five spaces
'implicit none' means you cant declare variables implicityly
    avoids implicit variable confusion
    have to declare all variables explicitly

counting loops
    DO icounter =  istart, iend, increment

restart a do loop from current line --> 'cycle'

logic tests are computationally expensive --> keep them out of loops

10/1
write 'unformatted' type files to reduce file size (compared to 'formatted')

faster to define array before compile so it doesnt have to do it during execution

fortran is column major order array(column,row)
    different than c++, etc

nice diagram of indexing through arrays vs. through grid, slide 23

10/6
***check for allocated arrrays (i.e slide 7)
    grading based on this

pointer --> reduced need to make COPIES of data, save memory
linked list --> each item linked to next
    good for arrays that you dont know what size they'll be
        (i.e. soring convergence histories, search results)

keep coding as simple as possible, limit classes
keep codes short --> put subroutines in separate files

project 1
xp, yp = x prime, y prime
run code on CLUSTER NODE (see lecture 1)
for residual history, only print first 10/last 10 iterations
time entire run, AND iteration loop
plot computational grid in techplot

10/8
debug check --> use analytic solution, calculate 1st/2nd order derivaties at
    each cell and compare
    Errors will occur due to grid strechting, debug on uniform grid

10/13
Thread Safety --> guarantee that a message will arrive exactly as it was sent
***clock function given by prof is different, uses MPI
