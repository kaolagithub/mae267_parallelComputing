\section{Statement of Problem}

This analysis details the solution of the steady-state temperature distribution on a 1m x 1m block of steel with Dirichlet boundary conditions (Eqn~\ref{dirichlet}).  Solutions were performed on square, non-uniform grids rotatated in the positive z-direction by $rot=30^o$.  Two grids of 101x101 points and 501x501 points were used to solve the equation of heat transfer.  Temperature was uniformly initialized to a value of 3.5 and the solution was iterated until the maximum residual found was less than $1.0x10^{-5}$.  The equation for heat conduction (Eqn~\ref{heat}) was solved using an explicit, node-centered, finite-volume scheme, with an alternative distributive scheme for the second-derivative operator.  Steady-state temperature distribution was saved in a PLOT3D unformatted file, and CPU wall time of the solver was recorded.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Equations and Algorithms}

The solver developed for this analysis utilizes a finite-volume numerical solution method to solve the transient heat conduction equation (Eqn~\ref{heat}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =
    k \left[ \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}
    + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} \right]
\end{split}
\label{heat}
\end{equation}

\noindent The solution is initialized with the Dirichlet boundary conditions (Eqn~\ref{dirichlet}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
T = &\left\{ \begin{array}{lll}
    \mbox{$5.0 \left[ \sin\left( \pi x_p \right) + 1.0 \right]$} & \mbox{for } &j = j_{max} \\
    \mbox{$\left| \cos\left( \pi x_p \right)\right|+1.0$} & \mbox{for } &j = 0 \\
    \mbox{$3.0 y_p + 2.0$} & \mbox{for } &i = 0, \, i_{max}
     \end{array} \right.
\end{split}
\label{dirichlet}
\end{equation}

\noindent Grids were generated according to the following (Eqn~\ref{grideqn})

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
   rot &= 30.0 \frac{\pi}{180.0} \\
   x_p &= \cos \left[ 0.5\pi \frac{i_{max}-i}{i_{max}-1} \right] \\
   y_p &= \cos \left[ 0.5\pi \frac{j_{max}-j}{j_{max}-1} \right] \\
x(i,j) &= x_p \cos(rot) + (1.0 - y_p) \sin(rot) \\
y(i,j) &= y_p \cos(rot) + x_p \sin(rot)
\end{split}
\label{grideqn}
\end{equation}

\noindent To solve Eqn~\ref{heat} numerically, the equation is discretized according to a node-centered finite-volume scheme, where first-derivatives at the nodes are found using Green's theorem integrating around the secondary control volumes.  Trapezoidal, counter-clockwise integration for the first-derivative in the x-direction is achieved with Eqn~\ref{FVx1st}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{2Vol_{i+\frac{1}{2},j+\frac{1}{2}}}
    \left[ \left(T_{i+1,j} + T_{i+1,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i+1,j} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j} + T_{i,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i,j} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j+1} + T_{i+1,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i,j+1} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j} + T_{i+1,j} \right)Ayi_{i,j} \right]
\end{split}
\label{FVx1st}
\end{equation}

\noindent A similar scheme is used to find the first-derivative in the y-direction.

\section{Results and Discussion}

Both grids used in this analysis were non-uniformly distributed according to the same function and can be observed in Figs~\ref{grid101} and ~\ref{grid501}

\end{center}
\end{figure}
%%\vspace{-2em}

\noindent It can be seen that the mesh becomes more refined nearer $i_{max}$ and $j_{max}$, and that the 501x501 point mesh is significantly more dense than its counterpart, which resulted in much longer wall times for solutions.

Figs~\ref{temp101} and ~\ref{temp501} show the steady-state temperature distribution on the steel plate for each mesh.  Very little difference is apparent, with the 501x501 mesh being slightly more dissipative near the hot/cold boundaries.

\section{Conclusion}

This project has produced a functional algorithm for solving steady-state heat conduction in serial.  Though CPU wall time of the 101x101 point grid was minimal (16.88 seconds), significant wall time was required to converge the solution for the 501x501 point grid (4763 seconds).  See Appendix A for more run parameter output.  Wall time could be reduced by parallelizing the code.
