\section{Statement of Problem}

This analysis details the solution of the steady-state temperature distribution on a 1m x 1m block of steel with Dirichlet boundary conditions (Eqn~\ref{dirichlet}).  Single-processor solutions were previously performed on a square, non-uniform grids rotatated in the positive z-direction by $rot=30^o$.  Two grids of 101x101 points and 501x501 points were used to solve the equation of heat transfer.  Temperature was uniformly initialized to a value of 3.5 and the solution was iterated until the maximum residual found was less than $1.0x10^{-5}$.  The equation for heat conduction (Eqn~\ref{heat}) was solved using an explicit, node-centered, finite-volume scheme, with an alternative distributive scheme for the second-derivative operator.  Steady-state temperature distribution was saved in a PLOT3D unformatted file, and CPU wall time of the solver was recorded.

Now, the code has been modified to decompose the domain into sub-domains refered to as blocks.  Boundary and neighbor information for each block is stored so that connectivity can be accurately assessed when communication between blocks is required.  The block domain, associated meshes, and initial temperature distribution are initialized and then saved to restart files.  These are read in at the beginning of the solver.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Equations and Algorithms}

The solver developed for this analysis utilizes a finite-volume numerical solution method to solve the transient heat conduction equation (Eqn~\ref{heat}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =
    k \left[ \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}
    + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} \right]
\end{split}
\label{heat}
\end{equation}

\noindent The solution is initialized with the Dirichlet boundary conditions (Eqn~\ref{dirichlet}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
T = &\left\{ \begin{array}{lll}
    \mbox{$5.0 \left[ \sin\left( \pi x_p \right) + 1.0 \right]$} & \mbox{for } &j = j_{max} \\
    \mbox{$\left| \cos\left( \pi x_p \right)\right|+1.0$} & \mbox{for } &j = 0 \\
    \mbox{$3.0 y_p + 2.0$} & \mbox{for } &i = 0, \, i_{max}
     \end{array} \right.
\end{split}
\label{dirichlet}
\end{equation}

\noindent Grids were generated according to the following (Eqn~\ref{grideqn})

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
   rot &= 30.0 \frac{\pi}{180.0} \\
   x_p &= \cos \left[ 0.5\pi \frac{i_{max}-i}{i_{max}-1} \right] \\
   y_p &= \cos \left[ 0.5\pi \frac{j_{max}-j}{j_{max}-1} \right] \\
x(i,j) &= x_p \cos(rot) + (1.0 - y_p) \sin(rot) \\
y(i,j) &= y_p \cos(rot) + x_p \sin(rot)
\end{split}
\label{grideqn}
\end{equation}

\noindent To solve Eqn~\ref{heat} numerically, the equation is discretized according to a node-centered finite-volume scheme, where first-derivatives at the nodes are found using Green's theorem integrating around the secondary control volumes.  Trapezoidal, counter-clockwise integration for the first-derivative in the x-direction is achieved with Eqn~\ref{FVx1st}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{2Vol_{i+\frac{1}{2},j+\frac{1}{2}}}
    \left[ \left(T_{i+1,j} + T_{i+1,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i+1,j} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j} + T_{i,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i,j} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j+1} + T_{i+1,j+1} \right)Ayi_{i,j+1} \right. \\
    \left. - \left(T_{i,j} + T_{i+1,j} \right)Ayi_{i,j} \right]
\end{split}
\label{FVx1st}
\end{equation}

\noindent A similar scheme is used to find the first-derivative in the y-direction.

Size of each block (no ghost nodes)
Total mesh points in I-direction including block overlap points:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
IMAX_{tot} = IMAX + (N-1)
\end{split}
\label{overlappoints}
\end{equation}

Points in I-direction per block

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
IMAXBLK = \frac{IMAX_{tot}}{N} = \frac{IMAX + (N-1)}{N} = 1 + \frac{IMAX-1}{N}
\end{split}
\label{pointsperblock}
\end{equation}

For points in J-direction, replace I with J and N with M

Global starting index of each block in I-direction:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
IMIN_{block} = IMIN_{global} + (IMAXBLK-1)(I-1)
\end{split}
\label{blockstartingindex}
\end{equation}

\noindent where I counts blocks in the direction of N and $IMIN_{global}=1$.  The first block in the N-direction has a global starting index of 0, and IMAXBLK must be reduced by one to account for the single-point overlap at block boundaries.

\section{Results and Discussion}

All simulations in this analysis were run on a 501x501 point grid, once with a single block solver and once with at 10x10 multi-block solver.  Fig~\ref{501x10x10} portrays the multi-block solution, which is comparable to that of the single block solver.  Convergence histories of the two solvers are compared in Fig~\ref{reshist}.  It can be seen that the two solvers are comparable in performance, both following a similar convergence path and converging at almost the same iteration.

Actual solver times are compared in Appendix A.  The multi-block solver was found to be approximately 11 seconds (2.6\%) faster than the single block solver.  This may be due to more code streamlining in the later project.  It can be expected that the speed of the multi-block solver will improve even further when linked-lists are employed to navigate neighbor boundary actions (this capability is currently functional in the code, but does not work on HPC1, so a logic-based approach was used for this project.)

\section{Conclusion}

Decomposing the domain introduced unforseen complications in adapting the single block solver.  In some cases, it was as simple as adding a third loop for the block number, but in others (especially in updating the ghost nodes) considerable thought and error-checking was required.  This implies that adapting the code for parallel processing will be an equally complicated step, so it is beneficial that we are adapting our codes modularly in stages.
